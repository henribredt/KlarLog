//  KlarLog
//


/// The primary entry point for logging in your application.
/// A `KlarLog` instance stores `CategoryLogger` instances in a registry and provides
/// ergonomic read-only access.
///
/// By using `@dynamicMemberLookup`, `KlarLog` provides direct access to registry
/// properties as if they were its own, returning fully-configured `ExposedCategoryLogger`
/// instances ready for logging. All logging is solely handled by `ExposedCategoryLogger`
/// instances that wrap the underlying `CategoryLogger` and provide logging APIs.
///
/// `KlarLog` is a lightweight facade that binds a logging registry to a subsystem
/// identifier by wrapping a registry of `CategoryLogger` instances and automatically
/// associates each logger with a subsystem string in the returned `ExposedCategoryLogger`.
///
/// Destinations are provided via a destinations registry that you supply at init.
/// `KlarLog` exposes that registry directly through `logger.destinations.<member>`, and also
/// collects all `LogDestination` values at init time to supply them to the exposed category loggers.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Define a registry with your application's logging categories of type `CategoryLogger`.
/// Perform `CategoryLogger` configuration in the registry's initializer or property declarations:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct CategoryLoggers: Sendable {
///    public let general = CategoryLogger(category: "general")
///    public let authentication = CategoryLogger(category: "auth")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Define a destinations registry with concrete `LogDestination` implementations:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct LogDestinations: Sendable {
///    public let console = ConsoleDestination()
///    public let file = LocalFileDestination(fileURL: .desktopDirectory, maxMessages: 800)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Create a single shared `KlarLog` instance at app startup:
///
/// ```swift
/// let log = KlarLog(
///     with: CategoryLoggers(),
///     destinationsRegistry: LogDestinations(),
///     subsystem: Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier ?? "com.example.app"
/// )
/// ```
///
/// Then log throughout your app using the configured categories:
///
/// ```swift
/// log.general.info("Starting request")
/// log.authentication.error("Password is empty String")
/// ```
///
/// Access destination instances directly from the destination registry you provided:
///
/// ```swift
/// let file = log.destinations.file // LocalFileDestination
/// let console = log.destinations.console // ConsoleDestination
/// ```
///
/// - Important: Only `CategoryLogger` properties on `Registry` are accessible via
///   dynamic member lookup on `KlarLog` (e.g., `log.general`). Other property types
///   should not be stored in the `Registry` and will not be exposed as `ExposedCategoryLogger`s.
